## How-to-Create-a-Data-Entry-Form-in-Excel

A data entry form can help by making the process faster and less error-prone.
Below is a data set that is typically maintained by the hiring team in an organization

Every time a user has to add a new record, he/she will have to select the cell in the next empty row and then go cell by cell to make the entry for each column.

While this is a perfectly fine way of doing it, a more efficient way would be to use a Data Entry Form in Excel.

Below is a data entry form that we can use to make entries to this data set.

## Parts of the Data Entry Form
A Data Entry Form in Excel has many different buttons (as you can see above).

Here is a brief description of what each button is about:
- New: This will clear any existing data in the form and allows you to create a new record.
- Delete: This will allow you to delete an existing record. For example, if I hit the Delete key in the above example, it will delete the record for Mike Banes.
- Restore: If you’re editing an existing entry, you can restore the previous data in the form (if you haven’t clicked New or hit Enter).
- Find Prev: This will find the previous entry.
- Find Next: This will find the next entry.
- Criteria: This allows you to find specific records. For example, if I am looking for all the records, where the candidate was Hired, I need to click the Criteria button, enter ‘Hired’ in the Status field and then use the find buttons. 
- Close: This will close the form.
- Scroll Bar: You can use the scroll bar to go through the records.
