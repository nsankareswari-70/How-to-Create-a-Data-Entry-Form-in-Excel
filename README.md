A data entry form can help by making the process faster and less error-prone.
Below is a data set that is typically maintained by the hiring team in an organization

Every time a user has to add a new record, he/she will have to select the cell in the next empty row and then go cell by cell to make the entry for each column.

While this is a perfectly fine way of doing it, a more efficient way would be to use a Data Entry Form in Excel.

Below is a data entry form that we can use to make entries to this data set.

## Parts of the Data Entry Form
A Data Entry Form in Excel has many different buttons (as you can see above).

Here is a brief description of what each button is about:
- New: This will clear any existing data in the form and allows you to create a new record.
- Delete: This will allow you to delete an existing record. For example, if I hit the Delete key in the above example, it will delete the record for Mike Banes.
- Restore: If you’re editing an existing entry, you can restore the previous data in the form (if you haven’t clicked New or hit Enter).
- Find Prev: This will find the previous entry.
- Find Next: This will find the next entry.
- Criteria: This allows you to find specific records. For example, if I am looking for all the records, where the candidate was Hired, I need to click the Criteria button, enter ‘Hired’ in the Status field and then use the find buttons. 
- Close: This will close the form.
- Scroll Bar: You can use the scroll bar to go through the records.

## Navigating Through Existing Records
One of the benefits of using Data Entry Form is that you can easily navigate and edit the records without ever leaving the dialog box.

This can be especially useful if you have a dataset with many columns. This can save you a lot of scrolling and the process of going back and forth.

Below are the steps to navigate and edit the records using a   data entry form:

Select any cell in the Excel Table.
Click on the Form icon in the Quick Access Toolbar.
To go to the next entry, click on the ‘Find Next’ button and to go to the previous entry, click the ‘Find Prev’ button

To edit an entry, simply make the change and hit enter. In case you want to revert to the original entry (if you haven’t hit the enter key), click the ‘Restore’ button.

### You can also use wildcard characters in criteria
